# Introduction #

description: >
	[Michael's story](http://www.interopen.org/content/IO4%20-%20Proposed%20project%20(Michael's%20story).pdf) has been widely developed, clinical assured and demonstrated at the [INTEROPen summit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ZKQjXAAxz-Arn9lKQXuwpmlv7kMoo_0jEmqgKQKOg/edit#). The following Epics, Scenario's and User Stories attempt to describe how Care Connect FHIR resources can be used to support Michael's story. The images have been taken from the [Interop Summit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwn8CEFskNi-anUzU3BQaWRoRlk/edit).

## Hospital discharge/encounter ##

{% include callout.html content="<b>Scenario:</b><br>'Michael is to be discharged from hospital, with a care plan, and Dr. Hospital prepares his discharge summary. Dr. Hospital reconciles and reviews Michael’s discharge medications and produces a reconciled list of discharge medications. This includes hospital managed medication, new medications commenced during the hospital admission, Michael’s own over-the-counter medication, ongoing medication from the GP or other sectors.' "%}

{% include callout.html content="<b>Further Conversations:</b><br>
This example refers to the reconciliation being performed by the doctor. The stories reflect this scenario and don’t explore the other cases where the reconciliation is performed by a technician or a pharmacist. This could be significant given that reconciliation by a technician when not validated by a pharmacist would include additional workflow for review." %}

| Story: >-
	As a clinician (hospital services) I want to continue medication that may have been put on hold during medicines reconciliation stage 1 on admission because the reasons that the drug were put on hold during the patient's admission are no longer relevant and the patient requires the medication for their ongoing condition. | POST <br>MedicationRequest |
| Story: >-
	As a clinician (hospital services) I may wish to add additional information in the form of a note or comment against each medication change that I make so when I am unable to resolve unintentional discrepancies there will be a notification to the the GP that some further consideration may be required. | POST <br> MedicationRequest |
